# SocialMediaClone
A full-stack MERN application that resembles a social media app. The project's features include authentication and authorization (bcrypt/JWT/react-redux/react-persist), posting texts and images (formik/yup/react-dropzone/express-validator/multer), different webpages for distinct purposes (react-router-dom), commenting and liking posts, adding and removing friends, as well as some other features that a typical social media app would have.
